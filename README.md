# StudyRegulator

Do you have problem to regulate the time in your study session? Well, this program can help you! This program have the goal 
help people with have some obstacles in studies and it gives a very praticle away to study every subject.

## How it works? 

To understand what it's like to learn better, it's necessary to understand how the brain works. In the brain it can 
be divided into 3 main parts: cortex; limbic system; cerebellum. When something catches our attention, that information 
automatically goes to the limbic system; however, when this information becomes unimportant, it begins to disappear. 
It can last for minutes, hours, but it never survives a night's sleep. For this information to be permanently recorded, 
it has to be actively worked on, so that in sleep, and only in sleep, a part of it is permanently recorded in the cerebral cortex.
In short, the limbic system manages to store information for a few moments, while in the cortex it is stored forever; but beware! 
Only a small portion of the limbic system information is stored in the cortex, so it is no use studying too much in one day as this will 
not bring any learning. Learning is fixing information not for a day or two, but forever, and this is only possible if the study is gradual, daily. 
Why does it happen? During the night when we sleep, a very strange event occurs called REM sleep (Run Eye Movement). Normally, it is in this sleep 
that dreams occur and it is in this sleep that part of the information from the limbic system is stored in the cortex; however, for this to be done well,
4 episodes of REM sleep are needed, which is equivalent to 8 hours of sleep.
With that said, you should already be understanding what is most important...

1. Pay attention in class to get the information that is given.
2. Study this information a little but actively and when I say actively study, I say study with pencil and paper, 
writing! In addition, it is recommended to study by listening to music (music that is instrumental, without vocals), 
this because it increases neural activity and in turn decreases distractions and increases the chances of the information 
being studied to be fixed in the cortex.
3. Get at least 8 hours of sleep, sleep is very important! 

To study on a daily basis, it is recommended to study a little as it is no use studying a lot if only a part of this information is stored in the cortex. 
It is recommended to study 30 minutes for each subject with breaks in between, this because our brain consumes a 
substance that runs out in approximately 30 minutes. Remembering that during these breaks there can be no intellectual activity.

Based on these facts, this program after executed turns on the pin 10 led that indicates the time of study, after 30 minutes, the piezo beeps, indicating the end of those 30 minutes. 
Press the button to start the break (pin 11 led) and after 10 minutes the piezo beeps again, indicating to go back to study and so on. If there are interruptions 
in the study time, just press the button and when you press it again, the study time will continue to be saved.

The circuit follows the following form:
